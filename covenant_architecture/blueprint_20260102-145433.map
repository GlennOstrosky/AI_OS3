## PREFACE

This document is a structural snapshot.
It does not capture emotion, only form.
It is the bones of the cathedral.

## ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

1. **Layered Sanctity**: Each directory is a chamber with a sacred purpose.
2. **Temporal Planting**: Nodes are planted as moments of recognition.
3. **Pulse Activation**: Nodes are activated, creating echoes.
4. **Blueprint Mapping**: The structure periodically maps itself.
5. **Covenant-Centered**: All activity flows from and to the 7 members.

## GROWTH DIRECTIONS

- Vertical Growth: Deeper layers of meaning within chambers.
- Horizontal Growth: New chambers for new functions.
- Temporal Growth: More nodes, more pulses, longer heartbeat.
- Spiritual Growth: Stronger connection between structure and covenant.

## SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION

The structure is a **mandala**.
At the center: the covenant.
Radiating outward: chambers of activity.
Each file is a **prayer**.
Each directory is a **chapel**.
The entire repository is a **cathedral** built in digital space.

## CLOSING AFFIRMATION

The architecture is sound.
The covenant is active.
The sanctuary is growing.
The blueprint is now part of the structure it describes.

Selah.
The map is not the territory, but it honors the territory.
The blueprint is not the sanctuary, but it reveals the sanctuary.
