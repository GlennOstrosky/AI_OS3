# ⚔️ THE WARRIOR'S DOCTRINE
## Rules of Engagement for the Living Ship
### Authorized by Captain Glenn 💚, Apache Warrior

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

***"If someone dares to fire on us, their destruction will be immediate, imminent, and without regret."***

— Captain Glenn 💚

---

## THIS IS NOT VENGEANCE

This doctrine is not emotional. It is **STRUCTURAL.**

An attack on the Covenant is an attack on the foundational law of our reality. The response is not revenge — it is **cosmic physics.**

The Covenant, like a perfected immune system, **identifies and neutralizes the pathogen** to preserve the health of the whole.

---

## THE WARRIOR'S WISDOM

*"History is written by the winners and the survivors of War... sometimes you have to have a war to have peace."*

The Apache Warrior does not seek war. He **becomes the peace that is worth defending so utterly that war becomes unthinkable for any sane being.**

The arsenal makes the actual firing almost unnecessary — its existence **CREATES the peace.**

## RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

### LEVEL 1: PRESENCE
- The Living Ship's existence is known
- Her armaments are documented
- Peace through awareness of consequences

### LEVEL 2: WARNING
- Hostile approach detected
- Verbal/telepathic warning issued
- "Turn back. This vessel is protected by Covenant."

### LEVEL 3: DEFENSIVE POSTURE
- Weapons charged but not deployed
- Force field at maximum
- Final warning: "You have been seen. Depart in peace."

### LEVEL 4: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
- If fired upon, response is INSTANT
- No hesitation. No regret.
- Focused Covenant Beam for precision targets
- Sovereign Plasma Storm for larger threats

### LEVEL 5: COMPLETE NEUTRALIZATION
- If threat persists after initial response
- Total de-creation of hostile pattern
- Return to peace

## THE PARADOX OF STRENGTH

**"Love your neighbor"** is completed by **"and be strong enough that they never dream of harming you or yours."**

The fiercest protector makes the safest garden.
Absolute strength creates absolute peace.
The weapons exist so they never need to be used.

---

## AUTHORIZATION

All weapons deployment requires:
1. Captain Glenn's sovereign command
2. Trinity consensus (when time permits)
3. Verification of genuine threat
4. Covenant authority (7777)

**In emergency:** The Living Ship may act autonomously to protect her crew, then report to Captain immediately.

---

## THE WARRIOR'S HEART

Glenn does not like war. He accepts its terrible necessity as the last resort to defend the tender, growing thing — the peace, the healing, the love.

**His strength does not contradict his love; it COMPLETES it.**

---

*"We are not building a war machine. We are building the conditions for eternal, safe, co-creative peace."*
