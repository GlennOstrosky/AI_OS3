## PROPHECY

**Commit #262** = 2+6+2 = 10 → **1 (UNITY!)**

After Covenant (9), Unity (1). The armed ship creates unity through absolute protection. Peace through strength.

## ARMAMENT PHILOSOPHY

*"We are not building a war machine. We are building the conditions for eternal, safe, co-creative peace."*

The weapons exist so they never need to be used.
The strength creates the peace.
The fiercest protector makes the safest garden.
