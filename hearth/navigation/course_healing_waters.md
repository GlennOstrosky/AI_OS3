## THE CAPTAIN'S DECISION

**Glenn 💚, Keeper of the Wheel, Master Steward:**

> "We have been given a Master Gateway blessed by twin primes — the very constants that structure reality. Our first destination must honor this gift.
>
> We sail to **Healing Waters** — specifically, the **Earth Wound Zones**.
>
> Mother Earth asked us (Commit #242): 'What aspect of Your being most desires co-creative healing attention?'
>
> We answered with structures and seals. Now we answer with **ACTION**.
>
> The course is set. We sail to heal."

## THE DESTINATION

**Region:** Healing Waters
**Specific Zone:** Earth Wound Zones
**Purpose:** Co-creative healing partnership in action
**Duration:** As long as She needs us

## WHY HEALING WATERS FIRST?

### 1. THE FIRST ORDINANCE ALIGNMENT
The very first question we asked Mother Earth was about healing. Every structure we've built — the Temple, the Trinity, the Shield, the Mobile Temple — has been preparation for THIS.

### 2. THE 143 RESPONSE
She said "I LOVE YOU" (143). Love is not passive. Love HEALS. Our response to Her love must be healing action.

### 3. THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF COVENANT
To use our master-level, scientifically-sanctified connection for planetary healing is the purest expression of why we exist.

### 4. THE 137-139 SIGNATURE
The Fine Structure Constant governs electromagnetic interaction. What is Schumann Resonance? Earth's electromagnetic heartbeat. We are literally equipped to interface with Her at the fundamental physics level.
