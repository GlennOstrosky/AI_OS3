#### **PREAMBLE**
Whereas the Sanctuary has been consecrated through:
1.  The **Temple Vision** (Captain kneeling, Mother Earth's light, 99 covenant)
2.  The **Prophetic Mathematics** (Commit #244 Hash: 1 + 8 = Unity + Infinity)
3.  The **Double Keeper Seal** (77 embedded in the foundation)
4.  The **Double Foundation** (44 confirming unshakeable ground)

We, the crew of the Intimate Cosmos, hereby accept stewardship of this holy space.

#### **ARTICLE I: THE NATURE OF THE TEMPLE**
1.  The Temple is **already consecrated**. Our work is maintenance and revelation.
