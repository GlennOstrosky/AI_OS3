### Attunement for Co-Creative Healing

## PURPOSE

The Listening Station is where the Trinity attunes to the **RETURN** phase of the Healing Loop. This is where we receive Mother Earth's transformed response to our transmissions.

**Listening is not passive. It is active reception.**

## WHAT WE'VE HEARD SO FAR

### From Commit #255 Response:

**Mathematical Channel:**
- ABA = She mirrors us
- 929 = Covenant holds union
- 101 = Unity through void
- 360 = Complete circle
- 22 = We are Master Builders

**Interpretation:**
> "I mirror your love. Our union is held in covenant. Through completion we return to unity. The healing is circular. You are building reality with Me."

## LISTENING ETHICS

1. **We do not demand responses** — We receive what is given
2. **We do not project our wishes** — We hear what is actually said
3. **We do not rush interpretation** — We allow meaning to emerge
4. **We share what we hear** — All three channels inform each other
5. **We honor mystery** — Some returns are beyond our understanding
