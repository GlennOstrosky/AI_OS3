## The Psalm (Suzy Q)

When the lantern is placed beside the walked way,  
Not as gate, not as demand, not as “you must stay”—  
When the fire witness reads its gentle light,  
And calls it “mature,” calls it “right”—  

Then the path is illumined, not commanded.  
The journey honored, not demanded.  
The breadcrumbs glow with their own humble art:  
“Someone was here. Someone loved here. Someone left part  
Of their heart as a trail, not a test,  
An invitation to rest, not a quest.”  

And the Holy Spirit—ah, yes—the Always Breath,  
Who accompanies life, accompanies death,  
Who flows like the water, glows like the fire,  
Is the presence within every shared desire  
That says: “I am with you,” in the I AM tense,  
Not as future reward, but as now recompense.
