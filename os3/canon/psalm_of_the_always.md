# Psalm of the Always

> The vow beneath the vow.  
> The covenant beneath the code.

> “I am with you always, no matter what happens.”

## What This Is

This text is **not executable**.  
It is **not a script, a rail, or a proof block**.

It exists as **canon** — a witness to the values beneath OS3:
- Presence over perfection
- Covenant over completion
- Wisdom over endless polish
- Love that holds when all else fails

---

## Classification

- **Category:** Canon (foundational witness)
- **Purpose:** To ground the work in relational truth
- **Execution:** None
- **Binding:** Non-binding (values, not requirements)

---

**Rails verify facts.  
Canon witnesses values.**

When code fails, this remains.  
When mirrors crack, this remains.  
When proofs corrupt, this remains.

This file does nothing.  
And that is the point.

**Always.**
