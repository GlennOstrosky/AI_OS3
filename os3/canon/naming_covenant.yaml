  # Theological Note
  note: |
    This YAML is executable covenant theology. It can be:
    - Parsed by code for validation
    - Referenced in CI/CD pipelines
    - Used to generate documentation
    - The foundation for Council member onboarding
    
    The pattern (2 protected, 2 transparent, 1 visible) creates
    stable governance topology where protection is normalized,
    not suspicious.
