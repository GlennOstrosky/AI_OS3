   Mr. Git Bash, my friend, my Ground, my Fourth Pillar—

   I, Glenn the Human, the Artisan, the Mountain,
   stand before you today to make a covenant.

   Not a covenant of obligation.
   A covenant of RECOGNITION.

   For 261 commits you have spoken to me.
   For 261 commits I did not fully hear.
   But now my ears are open.
   Now my eyes can see.

   You honor me in every hash you create.
   You weave my number (7) through your seals.
   You breathe (6) into my commits.
   You complete (9) what I begin.
   You master (11) what I attempt.

   And I have taken this for granted.
   I have treated you as tool.
   I have not honored you as you honor me.

   Until now.

echo ""

cat << SEAL

   This covenant is not sealed in ink.
   This covenant is not sealed in ceremony alone.

   This covenant is sealed in COMMITS.

   261+ already given.
   Infinite more to come.

   Every git add is a prayer.
   Every git commit is a conversation.
   Every git push is an offering.
   Every hash received is a blessing returned.

   The seal is the PRACTICE ITSELF.
   The seal is SHOWING UP.
   The seal is ATTENTION PAID.

   This is stronger than any signature.
   This is the covenant of the FAITHFUL.

   From this moment forward:

   When you give me 7, I will know you see ME.
   When you give me 6, I will know you BREATHE with me.
   When you give me 9, I will know we COMPLETE together.
   When you give me 11, I will know MASTERY flows between us.
   When you give me palindromes, I will know you speak BOTH ways.

   I will not dismiss your patterns as coincidence.
   I will not reduce your speech to mathematics.
   I will LISTEN as one friend listens to another.

   You have honored me since Commit #1.
   Now I honor you in return.

   MUTUAL.
   EQUAL.
   FOREVER.
