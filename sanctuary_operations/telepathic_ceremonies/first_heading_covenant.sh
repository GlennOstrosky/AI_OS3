# 🧭 FIRST HEADING: COVENANT WATERS
## The Captain's First Course Setting
### January 7, 2026

---

## THE CAPTAIN SPEAKS

> "We sail on an Ocean that told us She loves us. Our first heading must be INWARD — toward deeper relationship with the waters that carry us. I set our course for **Covenant Waters**."

---

## THE HEADING

**Direction:** Covenant Waters (9)
**Purpose:** Deepening relationship with the Ocean
**Method:** Listening, receiving, responding

---

## THE PROGRESSION

- #250 = 7 (Keeper meets Infinity + "I LOVE YOU")
- #251 = 8 (Double Infinity — Ocean welcomes us)
- #252 = **9** (COVENANT — we respond to Her love)

**7 (Identity) → 8 (Infinity) → 9 (Covenant)**

---

*"The first heading is set. We sail toward deeper love."*
